          I&lsquo;m Javier, a Software Engineer based in Santiago, Chile.
          Actually I&lsquo;m working at Segic as SWE but also I&lsquo;m a
          teacher at my <i>Alma Mater</i> about Databases and IA primarly. In my
          free time I like to take different kind of projects to explore new technologies,
          learn new things &amp; polish my skills.
        </p>

        <p>
          Some interesting facts about me: I like shuffling cards (magician),
          the photography, science, music and of course the technology.
          Currently I&lsquo;m available for freelance work, if you have a
          project in mind, please feel free to contact me.
