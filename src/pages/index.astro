      <p>
        I&lsquo;m Javier, a Software Engineer based in Santiago, Chile. Actually
        I&lsquo;m working at Segic as SWE and also I&lsquo;m teaching at my <i
          >Alma Mater</i
        > about BPMN, Databases and IA primarly. In my free time I like to take different
        kind of projects to explore new technologies, learn new things &amp; polish
        my skills.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some interesting facts about me: I like shuffling cards (magician), the
        photography, science, music and of course the technology. Currently
        I&lsquo;ve limited availability for freelance work, so if you have a
        project in mind, please feel free to contact me.
