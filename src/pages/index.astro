            I&lsquo;m Javier, a Software Engineer based in Santiago, Chile.
            Actually I&lsquo;m working at Segic as SWE but also I&lsquo;m a
            teacher at my <i>Alma Mater</i> about Databases and IA primarly. In my
            free time I like to take different kind of projects to explore new technologies,
            learn new things &amp; polish my skills.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some interesting facts about me: I like shuffling cards (magician),
            the photography, science, music and of course the technology.
            Currently I&lsquo;m available for freelance work, if you have a
            project in mind, please feel free to contact me.
